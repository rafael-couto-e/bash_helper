# Bash Helper

A list of bash command files to save time (on a long term).

## How do I use it?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a `bin` directory in your home directory (a.k.a. `/home/your.username`, or simply `~`).
3. Move/copy the content of the cloned repository to the new `~/bin/` directory
4. Append `export PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/bin` to the end of your `~/.bash_profile` file.
5. Reload your bash profile by running `. ~/.bash_profile`.
6. When needed, update the scripts based on your personal needs.
